## Overview

![screenshot](https://affectionate-ramanujan-1decce.netlify.app/Scarecrow.png)

The demo of this project can be visited [here](https://affectionate-ramanujan-1decce.netlify.app). This challenge provided to me abilities like search for the right information, but not the real solution for the problem. Was very exciting to build this and now is a real app. That's improved my HTML and CSS abilites, likewise learn a framework called Bootstrap.
Now, just keep training to be the better than i was ago.
